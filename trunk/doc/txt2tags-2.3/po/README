Txt2tags PO and POT files
-------------------------

These are the txt2tags program i18n files, which allows it
to be translated to other languages besides english.

txt2tags.pot
	The main translation file, with all the messages
	needed to be translated
	
*.po
	The translated messages for some languages

-----------------------------------------------------------

To translate txt2tags to your language:

1. Search which is the ID for your language. For example,
   "es" is for spanish, "de" is for german.

2. Copy the "txt2tags.pot" file as "<ID>.po".

3. Fill the "<ID>.po" file headers with your data.

4. Fill all the "msgstr" lines with the translations.

5. Use the "msgfmt -c --statistics <ID>.po" command to check
   the file syntax.

6. Follow the next steps to compile and install the
   messages on your system and test them.

7. Send the .po file to the txt2tags author, so it can be
   officially included on the program distribution and you
   will be part of the txt2tags team.

-----------------------------------------------------------

To install the translation file in your system (Linux):

   Note: I have no idea on how to do it on Windows.

1. Search where is the locale directory. For most systems
   it is "/usr/share/locale/".

2. Compile the .po into a .mo file with the following
   command: "msgfmt -o txt2tags.mo <ID>.po"

3. Move the .mo file to the locale directory, under the
   "<ID>/LC_MESSAGES/" directory, for example:
   "mv txt2tags.mo /usr/share/locale/pt_BR/LC_MESSAGES/"

4. Make sure your system is configured to the same language
   of your translation. Hint: "/etc/sysconfig/i18n"

5. Run txt2tags and check if it worked!
